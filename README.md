The online learning system is still not better than the offline learning system. Children's learning experience can be seen from the engagement level in learning. A pre-startup Ding Dong wants to create a system to measure behavioral engagement and emotional engagement with a camera. Based on these needs, this final project aims to design a program to detect student attendance (behavioral engagement) and classify students' emotions (emotional engagement) in online learning. This identification is done through the camera and sends it to the database. There is a web page for teachers to view and evaluate student data.

This system is made separately from the online learning platform. This system will use the student's laptop to process images from the webcam. The program will process the images to retrieve data on student engagement while studying. It applies the concept of deep learning using Python programming language. Before emotion classification stage, program will check student attendance with face detection.

The system can perform face detection and emotion classification of facial expressions based on the test results. When tested on children, the accuracy of reading facial expressions was 74.8%. The system can also display reading data for teacher evaluation materials on the website.
